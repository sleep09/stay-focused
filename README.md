# stay-focused

By Justin Choi(sleep09), and Evan Coulter(Evan-Coulter)

This is a simple productivity desktop app for linux users to track their study time with a timer and simple statistics.

An object file has been given for you to compile since we used some libraries c does not have in its libary. However, if you're to actually test this application, then you must use a linux operating system. 

Through your terminal, type in "sudo apt-get install glade" in which you'll install glade a program that works with gui. 

Then you install "type sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev" to install the gtk+3 Development.

Clone the project, cd to it, run make, the run the command ./StayFocusedU
